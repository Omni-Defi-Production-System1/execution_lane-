REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS FOR LIVE TRADING
================================================================================

⚠️  IMPORTANT: Simulation represents ideal conditions. Real-world factors:

Competition Factor:       30-50% of simulated profit expected
MEV/Frontrunning:         Higher than 7% failure rate initially
Network Congestion:       May reduce opportunity execution
DEX Liquidity:            May vary from simulation
Optimization Required:    Performance improves over time

   → Test with dummy tokens
   → Verify execution flow

STEP 3: Small Mainnet Start
   → Begin with $10k-$25k
   → Monitor for 1-2 weeks
   → Analyze performance

STEP 4: Scale Gradually
   → Increase to $50k if successful
